# Transfer Learning for Image Classification
# Overview: 
This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning classifier that distinguishes between images of ants and bees. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of 403 images, with features extracted using the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network.

# Key Features:
Image classification using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Hyperparameter tuning for each model to optimize performance.
Evaluation metrics including accuracy and F1 score.
Feature extraction using ResNet-18 for robust representation learning.

# Dependencies:
Python 3.x,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib
